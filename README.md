## 🚀 Starting

This project was developed as part of the WEB 1 course at UDESC, focusing on the fundamentals of web programming. The system encompasses exercises and concepts introduced during the course, such as creating and structuring HTML documents, utilizing CSS for styling, and implementing interactivity with JavaScript.  

The project includes hands-on activities like designing forms, embedding multimedia elements, and managing the layout using the box model. JavaScript exercises cover control structures, functions, event handling, and object manipulation. Additionally, basic server-side programming with PHP is introduced, allowing for tasks like form processing, data storage, and database interactions. This foundational work builds the essential skills required for modern web development.

## 📚 Features

Used during the evolution of the final project:

- HTML 5: Forms, audio, and video integration.  
- CSS: Formatting (colors, backgrounds, fonts), element grouping, and the box model.  
- JavaScript: Control structures, functions, arrays, objects, and event handling.  
- PHP: Data types, operators, conditional structures, loops, strings, regular expressions, form processing, file handling, and database manipulation.
